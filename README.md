# starboard-tiddlywiki
Starboard-notebook(https://starboard.gg/) and TiddlyWiki5(https://tiddlywiki.com/) on the same webpage to streamline the note-taking process on the browser.



### How to use?
Clone repo, open index.html in browser and run the starboard cell with "<iframe..." by hitting the play button on the left. This will open a simple pdf.

Please refer to the starboard and tiddlywiki documentation online for more information and use cases.


### Why?
The motivation of this was to glue a great note taking platform (TW5) with a 'terminal' that is capable of running HTML/JS code on the go (Starboard). Importantly, both of these run on the browser without any need of a dedicated server.
